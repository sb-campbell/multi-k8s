Required Updates for Cert Manager Install

In the upcoming lecture, we will be installing the Cert Manager using Helm on Google Cloud. There have been some breaking changes introduced with the latest versions of Cert Manager, so we will need to do a few things differently.

Instead of the installation instructions given at around 1:20 in the video, we will complete these steps in the GCP Cloud Shell:

    Add the Jetstack Helm repository

      helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

    Update your local Helm chart repository cache:

      helm repo update

    Install the cert-manager Helm chart:

        helm install \
          cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
          --namespace cert-manager \
          --create-namespace \
          --version v1.8.0 \
          --set installCRDs=true

----------

    * Creates a cert-manager deployment and pod, a user with GCP RBAC privs, infra to respond to HTTPS challenges (ie. route handler for LetsEncrypt interrogation), retrieves cert and stores it in a K8s secret 
        * requires K8s object .yaml config files...
            * issuer(s) - tells cert-manager where to get the cert
            * certificate(s) - object describing details about the certificate that should be obtained

    Once the cert is obtained and stored in K8s secret, reconfigure ingress-nginx to force https and use the cert
