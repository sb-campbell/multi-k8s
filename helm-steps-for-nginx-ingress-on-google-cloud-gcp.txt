Helm v3 Update

updated 9-22-2020

In the next lecture, we will be installing Helm. Helm v3 has since been released which is a major update, as it removes the use of Tiller. Please follow the updated instructions for this version below:

1. Install Helm v3:

In your Google Cloud Console run the following:

    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh

link to the docs:

https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script

2. Skip the commands run in the following lectures:

Helm Setup, Kubernetes Security with RBAC, Assigning Tiller a Service Account, and Ingress-Nginx with Helm. You should still watch these lectures and they contain otherwise useful info.

3. Install Ingress-Nginx:

In your Google Cloud Console run the following:

    helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
    helm install my-release ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx

IMPORTANT: If you get an error such as chart requires kubeVersion: >=1.16.0-0.....

You may need to manually upgrade your cluster to at least the version specified:

gcloud container clusters upgrade  YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --master --cluster-version 1.16

This should not be a long term issue since Google Cloud should handle this automatically:
